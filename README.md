### Hi, I'm Yiying🌸 

I built my first website at 11 years old and turned my childhood hobby into a career. I combine my Fine Arts background and problem-solving skills to create beautiful, user-friendly sites with emphasis on readable code and accessibility. As a self-motivated learner who values collaboration, I love taking on new challenges and making meaningful contributions to a team.

Thanks for visiting my Github! \(●'◡'●\)
